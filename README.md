# Hacks/Hackers DC December Meetup
## "Playing with congressional data from the ProPublica Congress API"

Welcome to the [December meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-DC/events/245285906/) for [Hacks/Hackers DC](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-DC/).

This is an opportunity to learn a bit about using the excellent ProPublica Congress API, which allows you to access a host of detailed information about the U.S. Congress.

### Schedule - noon - 4 p.m.
* **12 - 12:15** - Gathering
* **12:15 - 12:20** - Brief overview of ProPublica Congress API.
* **12:20 - 12:40** - Gather in small groups. Review API endpoints and data. Discuss potential ideas for short-term projects groups might work on.  Form consensus around your favorite idea (or two). Post a sentence (or two, max) about the idea in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjcgqfoBARPW_J8ZebXhiUOMpWJWGkn8LuGzORIW08k/edit#).  Put down name (or names) of people in the group who want to gather people together to work on the idea. Also put what your preferred language is, which might help people decide where to go after the next step.  
* **12:40 - 12:50** - Review ideas in Google Doc. Put you name next to idea you want to work on, then find idea organizer and get to work!
* **1:00 - 3:30** - Work on stuff
* **3:30 - 4:00** - Wrap up. Quick presentations on group progress, if you want.  You might also share ideas for where you can take it if you leave here, and coordinate with people who want to work together going forward.

[Put your ideas in here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjcgqfoBARPW_J8ZebXhiUOMpWJWGkn8LuGzORIW08k/edit#), then use this doc to find groups to work with.

### Sample code, packages, etc... to help you get started

We've forked some Git repos that will help you get started with the API using Python, R, JavaScript or PHP.  If you know of another source you'd like to share, please submit a pull request (or just tell one of the organizers and we'll add it).
